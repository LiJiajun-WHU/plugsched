## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. Review [Debian-ARM64-Guide_zh.md](./docs/Debian-ARM64-Guide_zh.md)
2. Set up test environment (VM or test machine)
3. Run baseline benchmarks
4. Apply patches incrementally
5. Test each modification independently

### During Testing
1. Use provided benchmark scripts
2. Monitor system stability
3. Check kernel logs (dmesg)
4. Verify feature flags work correctly
5. Measure performance improvements

### After Testing
1. Compare results with baseline
2. Document any issues found
3. Validate in staging environment
4. Plan production rollout carefully

## Usage Example

```bash
# 1. Setup environment (from Debian-ARM64-Guide)
cd /tmp/work
plugsched-cli init $(uname -r) ./kernel ./scheduler

# 2. Apply CFS experiment
cd scheduler
patch -p1 < /path/to/plugsched/examples/cfs-vruntime-experiment.diff

# 3. Build and install
cd /tmp/work
plugsched-cli build ./scheduler
sudo rpm -ivh scheduler/working/rpmbuild/RPMS/aarch64/scheduler-*.rpm

# 4. Enable and test
echo CFS_VRUNTIME_EXP > /sys/kernel/debug/sched_features
./benchmark-scheduler.sh
```
